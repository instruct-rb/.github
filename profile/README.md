# Instruct Ruby

[instruct-rb.com](https://instruct-rb.com)

## The Plan
### 1. Instruct (Experimenting Now)
Build a great foundation for working with different LLMs and doing complex prompting. Use middleware to manage complexities and build upon attributed string system for easy multi-modal LLM integration and flexiblity in adding new capabilites. Add streaming validation and parsing.

### 2. Production Data Collection (Next)
A gem that builds on Instruct to collect prompts and completions in production. Creates datasets for data-driven prompt optimization and fine-tuning.

### 3. Optimization Workflow (Planned)
Enable both human driven and LLM prompt optimization with integrated fine-tuning using production data.

### 4. Self-Optimizing Systems (Planned)
Why deploy optimizations when you can let your model optimize itself?
